## Challenge: Choose your favourite wallpaper

Now try out the different wallpapers and settings and find your favourite. You may also need to change the Text colour so that it's clear or just because you prefer a different colour. 

If you have access to the internet you could also download images that you have permission to use. You can choose a Picture from your Download folder by selectping `pi` and then `Downloads`.

You could even draw your own picture. If you open the Main Menu and choose `Preferences` and then `Add / Remove Software` then you can search for and add Pinta, a simple drawing and painting program.
