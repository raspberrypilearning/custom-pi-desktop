## Challenge: choose your favourite wallpaper

Now try out the different wallpapers and settings and find your favourite. You may also need to change the **Text Colour** so that the text is clear, or because you prefer a different colour.

If you have access to the internet, you could also download images that you have permission to use. To choose a picture from your **Downloads** folder, select **pi** and then **Downloads**.

Change the other settings to get the result that you want.

**Tip:** If you want to browse the included desktop images, you can find them in the **File System** under `/usr/share/rpd-wallpaper`.

You could even draw your own picture. If you have full Raspbian installation then you could use LibreOffice Draw or Scratch.

If you have access to the internet, then you could install Pinta. To install Pinta, go to the main menu and choose **Preferences**, then **Add / Remove Software**, then you can search for and add Pinta, a simple drawing and painting program.
