## Introduction

In this project, you will learn how to customise your Raspberry Pi desktop so that it looks and works the way that you want it to. You'll choose colours that work well together, and find out how to represent colours so that a computer can understand them. You'll also think about how changes can improve the usability of the desktop for you.

### What you will make

You will change how your Raspberry Pi desktop looks and save the settings.
