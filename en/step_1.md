## Introduction

In this project you'll learn how to customise your Raspberry Pi desktop so that it looks and works the way you want it to. You'll choose colours that work well together and find out how to represent colours so a computer can understand them. You'll also think about how changes can improve the usability of the desktop for you.

### What you will make

You will change the way the Raspberry Pi Desktop looks and save the settings.
